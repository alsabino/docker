# docker
've create this see that we have proxy on the company that I'm currently working and because of this any apt-get inside debian image get denied or timeout on the request. So this Docker file is to build a image with proxy settings already copied to the directories on debian:jessie image. Remember to edit the proxy settings files before build the docker image or use vim on each file location to set your current proxy settings.

I've followed this tutorial to configure proxy on debian: https://codepoets.co.uk/2014/debian-http_proxy-setting/

Also I'm new with Docker, Github and so many other technologies, if you want to send me a feedback or advise anything that help me to improve and learn please send me the feedback =)
